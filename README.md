## **Git Branch Instructions**
Developers must **not** use the `main` branch directly. Instead, follow these steps to create and use a feature branch:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DolphinAnalyticsAI/connies-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd connies-website
   ```

3. **Create a new feature branch** named with your first name (e.g., `feature/xxxxxxx`):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-name
   ```

4. **Do your work** in the `/site` subfolder. Make sure to follow the design and functionality specifications in the `/requirements` folder.

5. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message here"
   ```

6. **Push your feature branch** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your feature branch to the `main` branch for review.
