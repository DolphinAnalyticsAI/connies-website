# BlueprintForge: AI-Powered Business Blueprint Generator

## Overview
BlueprintForge is an AI-powered workflow that transforms a single **seed** (provided by the user) into a fully detailed **business blueprint**. The process is fully automated, with each step handled by a specialized AI agent. The user only needs to provide the seedâ€”everything else is generated by the system.
