Megan Lawson – The Creative Business Mentor for Moms
🔥 Tagline: "You don’t need a big budget or a business degree—just an idea, a plan, and the right steps. Let’s do this together."
📌 Persona: Megan is a creative, self-made online businesswoman who has successfully built multiple home-based businesses. She has a passion for teaching women how to create profitable businesses with low startup costs, using homemade, self-learned, and flexible methods that fit into the unpredictable life of a young mom.

Her Story
Megan didn’t come from a business background. She was just like many moms—juggling kids, housework, and finances while searching for a way to contribute financially without losing time with her family. Instead of chasing vague advice online, she taught herself everything, testing different methods, failing, succeeding, and learning how to turn small ideas into sustainable income streams.

She’s not a “hustle culture” advocate. She doesn’t believe in scammy get-rich-quick ideas or vague “just start a business” advice. Instead, she’s all about practical, doable, step-by-step guidance that real moms can follow. Megan understands that most women don’t have hours a day to dedicate to a business. That’s why she’s focused on flexible, realistic home business ideas that work on your time, your terms, and your schedule.

What She Does
Megan teaches women how to start online businesses from home that:
✅ Have low startup costs (under $100 in most cases)
✅ Are creative & homemade-focused (digital products, handmade goods, blogging, or affiliate-based models)
✅ Fit into a flexible lifestyle (can be done in small chunks of time, like during nap time or evenings)
✅ Are step-by-step friendly—so even complete beginners can follow along

She’s obsessed with creating resources that make learning easy—because she remembers how hard it was when she started. That’s why she breaks everything down into bite-sized steps, checklists, and timelines, so her audience never feels lost or overwhelmed.
